#### The idea ####
In Oriental culture, we all love the legend of Monkey king who traveled to the West and become a Buddha.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong
https://www.google.com/search?q=Monkey+King
( Songoku in Japanese )

I compose the idea with wild jungle scenes in fictional oriental - western mixed scenery and theme, and adventures along the jouney.
